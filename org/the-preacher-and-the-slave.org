Long-haired preachers come out every night
Try to tell you what's wrong and what's right
But when asked how 'bout something to eat
They will answer in voices so sweet

You will eat, bye and bye
In that glorious land in the sky above the sky
Work and pray, live on hay
You'll get pie in the sky when you die

And the Starvation Army, they play
And they sing and they clap and they pray
Till they get all your coin on the drum
Then they tell you when you're on the bum

You will eat, bye and bye
In that glorious land in the sky above the sky
Work and pray, live on hay
You'll get pie in the sky when you die

Holy Rollers and Jumpers come out
And they holler, they joum and they shout
Give your money to Jesus, they say
He will cure all diseases today

You will eat, bye and bye
In that glorious land in the sky above the sky
Work and pray, live on hay
You'll get pie in the sky when you die

If you fight hard for children and wife
Try to get something good in this life
You're a sinner and bad man, they tell
When you die you will sure go to hell

You will eat, bye and bye
In that glorious land in the sky above the sky
Work and pray, live on hay
You'll get pie in the sky when you die

Workingmen of all countries, unite
Side by side we for freedom will fight
When the world and its wealth we have gained
To the grafters we'll sing this refrain

You will eat, bye and bye
When you've learned how to cook and how to fry
Chop some wood, 'twill do you good
Then you'll eat in the sweet bye and bye
