Coos Bay to North Bay, Laurel to L'Anse, Camp Blues to Tassus to Trey
The Woodworkers' Union, our strongest response.  We'll fight till we prevail

Logging camps and plywood mills, fir and southern pine
Democracy, autonomy, the Union, yours and mine
Bosses fear the rank and file, we'll join for victory
The International Woodworkers' will fight for you and me

Wages and pensions, children to feed, sick leave and holiday pay
Fighting together, we'll get what we need within the IWA

Logging camps and plywood mills, fir and southern pine
Democracy, autonomy, the Union, yours and mine
Bosses fear the rank and file, we'll join for victory
The International Woodworkers' will fight for you and me

When finally old people can come to their goal
Of jobs that are safe with high pay
The leader of workers, you ought to be told, will still be IWA

Logging camps and plywood mills, fir and southern pine
Democracy, autonomy, the Union, yours and mine
Bosses fear the rank and file, we'll join for victory
The International Woodworkers' will fight for you and me

P.S.: I can't figure out is it "old people can" or "old people can't"
