Which side are you on boys
Which side are you on
Which side are you on boys
Which side are you on

They say in Harlan County
There are no neutrals there
You'll either be a union man
Or a thug for J. H. Blair

Which side are you on boys
Which side are you on
Which side are you on boys
Which side are you on

My daddy was a miner
And I'm a miner's son
He'll be with you fellow workers
Until this battle's won

Which side are you on
Which side are you on
Which side are you on
Which side are you on

Oh workers can you stand it
Oh tell me how you can
Will you be a lousy scab
Or will you be a man

Which side are you on
Which side are you on
Which side are you on
Which side are you on

Come all you good workers
Good news to you I'll tel
Of how the good old union
Has come in here to dwell

Which side are you on
Which side are you on
Which side are you on
Which side are you on
