When the Union's inspiration through the workers' blood shall run
There can be no power greater anywhere beneath the sun
Yet what force on Earth is weaker than the feeble force (strength) of one
But the Union makes us strong

Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
For the union makes us strong

Is there aught we hold in common with the greedy parasite
Who would lash us into serfdom and would crush us with his might
Is there anything left to us but to organize and fight
For the Union makes us strong

Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
For the union makes us strong

It is we who plowed the prairies, built the cities where they trade
Dug the mines and built the workshops, endless miles of railroad laid
Now we stand outcast and starving 'mid the wonders we have made
But the Union makes us strong

Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
For the union makes us strong

All the world that's owned by idle drones is ours and ours alone
We have laid the wide foundations, built it skyward stone by stone
It is ours, not to slave in, but to master and to own
While the Union makes us strong

Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
For the union makes us strong

They have taken untold millions that they never toiled to earn
But without our brain and muscle not a single wheel can turn
We can break their haughty power, gain our freedom when we learn
That the Union makes us strong

Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
For the union makes us strong

In our hands is placed a power greater than their hoarded gold
Greater than the might of armies (atoms) magnified a thousand-fold
We can bring to birth a new world from the ashes of the old
For the Union makes us strong

Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
For the union makes us strong
