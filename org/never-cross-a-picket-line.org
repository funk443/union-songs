Five hundred men sacked for refusing to ever cross a picket line
The voices down the ages warning "never cross a picket line"
You must never cross a picket line

Two years gone by but still they never ever cross a picket line
With their wives and children they stand together, never cross a picket line
You must never cross a picket line

Look away, look away
Look away out west to San Francisco
Look away, look away
Look away down south to Sydney Harbour
Where the dockers have organised
The world's longest picket line

Technically this is an illegal strike, never cross a picket line
But technically workers have no rights, never cross a picket line
You must never cross a picket line

Oh, I want to live in a Brand New Britain, never cross a picket line
Where workers rights are enshrined and written, never cross a picket line
You must never cross a picket line

Look away, look away
Look away out west to San Diego
Look away, look away
Look away out east to far Osaka
Where the dockers have organised
The world's longest picket line

The Tories are gone but there's no improvement, never cross a picket line
Now where is the might of the labour movement, never cross a picket line
You must never cross a picket line

Look away, look away
Look away down south to Auckland City
Look away, look away
Look away out west to old Vancouver
Where the dockers have organised
The world's longest picket line

For the dockers have realised
You must never cross a picket line
