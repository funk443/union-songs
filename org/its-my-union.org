When the papers run by Tories carry terrifying stories
Of the horrid Union bosses who oppress me
They can rant and scream and rage, I just turn the other page
Those bedtime stories really don't impress me

'Cause it's my Union, I built a Union
If they want to know who runs it, it's you and I
And no matter what they say, the Union's here to stay
I'll fight in the Union till I die

When the TV commentators say my leaders are dictators
Call them Moscow agents, Reds and such
I ignore their indignation, tune in some other station
Their ravings don't impress me very much

'Cause it's my Union, I built a Union
If they want to know who runs it, it's you and I
And no matter what they say, the Union's here to stay
I'll fight in the Union till I die

When a bought and paid for stool tries to make me out a fool
By saying my Union should be split
I just tell him, keep on walking, that's the boss's money talking
There ain't no good in peddling that shit

'Cause it's my Union, I built a Union
If they want to know who runs it, it's you and I
And no matter what they say, the Union's here to stay
I'll fight in the Union till I die

You can call me agitator, even call me traitor
Say that my head's gone off its track
Well I can plainly see what the Union's done for me
So I'm rolling up my sleeves and fighting back

'Cause it's my Union, I built a Union
If they want to know who runs it, it's you and I
And no matter what they say, the Union's here to stay
I'll fight in the Union till I die

'Cause it's my Union, I built a Union
I'll fight in the Union till I die
