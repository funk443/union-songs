I am a Union man
Amazed at what I am
I say what I think, that the company stinks
Yes I'm a Union man

When we meet in the local hall
I'll be voting with them all
With a hell of a shout, it's "Out brothers, out!"
And the rise of the factory's fall

Oh, you don't get me, I'm part of the Union
you don't get me, I'm part of the Union
you don't get me, I'm part of the Union
Till the day I die, till the day I die

As a Union man I'm wise
To the lies of the company spies
And I don't get fooled by the factory rules
'Cause I always read between the lines

And I always get my way
If I strike for higher pay
When I show my card to the Scotland Yard
And this is what I say

Oh, you don't get me, I'm part of the Union
you don't get me, I'm part of the Union
you don't get me, I'm part of the Union
Till the day I die, till the day I die

Before the union did appear
My life was half as clear
Now I've got the power to the working hour
And every other day of the year

So though I'm a working man
I can ruin the government's plan
And though I'm not hard, the sight of my card
Makes me some kind of superman

Oh, you don't get me, I'm part of the Union
you don't get me, I'm part of the Union
you don't get me, I'm part of the Union
Till the day I die, till the day I die

you don't get me, I'm part of the Union
you don't get me, I'm part of the Union
you don't get me, I'm part of the Union
Till the day I die, till the day I die
