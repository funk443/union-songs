Are you poor, forlorn and hungry
Are there lots of things you lack
Is your life made up of misery
Then dump the bosses off your back

Are your clothes all patched and tattered
Are you living in a shack
Would you have your troubles scattered
Then dump the bosses off your back

Are you almost split asunder
Loaded like a long-eared jack
Boob why don't you buck like thunder
And dump the bossees off your back
All the agonies you suffer
You can end with one good whack
Stiffen up, you orn'ry duffer
And dump the bosses off your back
